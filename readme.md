<h2>How to Use IR SENSOR module and RELAY module with WIZnet W5100S-EVB-Pico</h2>
<p>In this project we will make our existing work desk a smart one. We will control all our electronic gadgets with a Relay Module equipped with an IR sensor.
When the IR sensors detect any object i.e. anyone is sitting on the desk, depending on how the pins are configured, it will turn on/off the charger, monitor and other devices connected to the Relay Module.

<h2>Story</h2>
<p>There is a huge wastage of energy in our daily life, which can be saved if we turn off the devices when not in use. Unfortunately we humans are so busy that we forget to turn them off. So to solve this problem, we thought of making all the electrical components smart.
Initially we started with making our work desk smart. For this we placed an IR sensor on the desk which will detect if anyone is sitting on the desk, and toggle its output. The IR sensor is connected to a microcontroller which controls the Relays based on the output of the IR sensor.

        <p>IR Sensor<br/>IR sensor is an electronic device that emits light in order to sense some object of the surroundings. An IR sensor can measure the heat of an object as well as detect the motion. Usually, in the infrared spectrum, all the objects radiate some form of thermal radiation.</p>

        <p>4ch Relays<br/>A power relay module is an electrical switch that is operated by an electromagnet. The electromagnet is activated by a separate low-power signal from a microcontroller. When activated, the electromagnet pulls to either open or close an electrical circuit.</p>
